# Tic Tac Toe Game in C

This is a simple **Tic Tac Toe game** implemented in C that can be played by two players in the terminal.  
It uses basic concepts of arrays, functions, and conditional logic.

---

## 🧩 Features
- Two-player game mode.
- Displays the board dynamically after every move.
- Detects invalid moves (if a position is already occupied).
- Declares the winner or a draw.
- Uses emojis ❌ and ⭕ for a better visual experience.

---

## 🧠 Logic Explanation
- The game board is represented using a 1D array of size 9.
- The `print()` function is used to draw the grid and update it with each move.
- The `check()` function verifies winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals).
- Player 1 always plays with ❌ (X), and Player 2 plays with ⭕ (O).
